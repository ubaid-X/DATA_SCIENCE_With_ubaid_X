    "> # __What is Algebra?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and letters to represent number and quantities in formulea and equations. It's like a puzzle where we solve for the unknown values that make the equation true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Algebra as a way to solve puzzles where you need to find a missing number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For Example, if you have `5 + ? = 10`, algebra helps you figure out that the missing number is `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Main elements of Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Arithmatic__:- it is basic mathematics operations like `+, -, *, /, % etc`\n",
    "2. __Variable__:- to assign a number or quantity to a letter or symbol.\n",
    "- For Example: `5 + x = 10` where `x` is the variable.\n",
    "3. __Expression__:- a combination of numbers, variables, and operations.\n",
    "- For Example: `2x + 3` is an expression.\n",
    "4. __Equation__:- a statement that two expressions are equal.   Equation_1 `=` Equation_2\n",
    "- For Example: `2x + 3 = 7` is an equation.  \n",
    "- 2nd Example: 5x +1 = 12y + 3\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Why is Algebra Important?\n",
