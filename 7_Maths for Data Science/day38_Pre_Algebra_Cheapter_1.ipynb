    "\n",
    "1. __Natural Numbers__: These are the numbers we naturally count with. They start from 1 and go on indefinitely (1, 2, 3, …). \n",
    "  - __Example__: The number of apples in a basket (assuming there’s at least one) is a natural number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Whole Numbers__: Whole numbers include all natural numbers and the number 0. \n",
    "  - __Example__: The number of cars in a parking lot, which could be zero or any natural number.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Integers__: Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. This includes numbers like -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, … \n",
    "  - __Example__: The temperature above or below zero on a thermometer is an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Rational Numbers__: Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers, where the denominator is not zero. They can be written as fractions. \n",
    "  - __Example__: The number 1/2 is rational because it represents one divided by two.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Irrational Numbers__: Irrational numbers cannot be expressed as a simple fraction; their decimal expansions are non-repeating and non-terminating. \n",
    "  - __Example__: The square root of 2 (√2) is an irrational number because it cannot be precisely written as a fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. __Real Numbers__: Real numbers include all the rational and irrational numbers. The number line represents real numbers.\n",
    "  - __Example__: Pi (π), which is approximately 3.14159, is a real number.\n",

    "__Arithmetic Operations__: These are the basic operations we perform with numbers:\n",

    "1. __Addition (+)__: Combining two amounts. \n",
    "   - __Example__: If you have 3 apples and get 2 more, you now have 3 + 2 = 5 apples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Subtraction (-)__: Finding the difference between amounts. \n",
    "   - __Example__: If you have 5 apples and eat 2, you have 5 – 2 = 3 apples left.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. __Multiplication (×)__: Repeated addition of the same number. \n",
    "   - __Example__: If you have 4 bags with 3 apples each, you have 4 × 3 = 12 apples.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. __Division (÷)__: Splitting into equal parts or groups. \n",
    "   - __Example__: If 12 apples are divided among 4 friends, each friend gets 12 ÷ 4 = 3 apples.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. __Variable__: A variable is a symbol (usually a letter) that stands for a number that can vary or change. \n",
    "   - __Example__: In the expression x + 2, x is a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Constant__: A constant is a fixed value that does not change. \n",
    "   - __Example__: In the expression x + 2, the number 2 is a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Coefficient__: A coefficient is a number used to multiply a variable.\n",
    "   -  __Example__: In 3x, 3 is the coefficient of the variable x.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Expression__: An expression is a combination of variables, numbers, and operations. \n",
    "    - __Example__: 2x + 3y – 5 is an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Equation__: An equation is a statement that two expressions are equal, indicated by the equal sign (=). \n",
    "   - __Example__: 2x + 3 = 11 is an equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. __Inequality__: An inequality is like an equation, but instead of equality, it shows a relationship of less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal to (≤), or greater than or equal to (≥). \n",
    "   - __Example__: x + 3 > 5 is an inequality.\n",
