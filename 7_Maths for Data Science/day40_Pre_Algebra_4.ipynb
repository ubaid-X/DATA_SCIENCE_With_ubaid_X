    "\n",
    "- __Two-step Equations:__\n",
    "Two-step equations require two steps to solve. This often involves a combination of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example:__ Solve 2x + 3 = 7 by first subtracting 3 from both sides to get 2x = 4, then dividing both sides by 2 to get x = 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Multi-step Equations:__\n",
    "Multi-step equations may involve several operations and require multiple steps to solve, including the use of the distributive property and combining like terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "___Example:__ Solve 3(x + 2) – 4 = 11 by first applying the distributive property, then combining like terms, and finally isolating the variable x.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Solving Inequalities__\n",
    "- __Graphing Inequalities:__\n",
    "Graphing inequalities involves shading a region of the number line or coordinate plane that represents all solutions to the inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example:__ To graph x > 3 on a number line, put an open circle at 3 and shade to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Compound Inequalities__\n",
    "Compound inequalities involve two separate inequalities that are joined by either “and” or “or”.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example:__ The compound inequality 2 < x and x < 5 means x is greater than 2 and less than 5.\n",

    "- __Length, Mass, Volume, and Time:__\n",
    "Units of measurement are used to quantify physical quantities. Length is measured in meters, centimeters, feet, etc., mass in kilograms or pounds, volume in liters or gallons, and time in seconds, minutes, hours, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Metric and Imperial Units:__\n",
    "The metric system uses units like meters, liters, and grams, while the imperial system uses units like feet, gallons, and pounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Unit Conversion:__\n",
    "Unit conversion involves changing a quantity expressed in one set of units to another set of units using a conversion factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example:__ Convert 5 kilometers to miles by multiplying 5 by the conversion factor 0.621371 (5 km * 0.621371 = 3.106855 miles).\n",

    "Points are locations in space, lines are one-dimensional figures that extend infinitely, and angles are formed by two rays meeting at a point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Triangles:__\n",
    "Triangles are three-sided polygons characterized by three edges and three vertices. The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.\n",

    "Quadrilaterals are four-sided polygons with various types including squares, rectangles, and parallelograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Circles:__\n",
    "A circle is a round shape where every point on the boundary is the same distance from the center. The distance around a circle is its circumference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Perimeter and Area:__\n",
    "The perimeter of a shape is the distance around it, while the area is the measure of space inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example:__ The perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width), and the area is length * width.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __Surface Area and Volume:__\n",
    "Surface area is the total area that the surface of an object occupies, and volume measures the space an object occupies.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example:__ The surface area of a cube is 6 * (edge length)^2, and its volume is (edge length)^3.\n",
