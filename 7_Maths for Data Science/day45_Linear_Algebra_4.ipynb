    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "A **basis vector** is like a main direction we can use to describe all other vectors. A **unit vector** is any vector that is exactly 1 unit long. We often use unit vectors *as* our basis vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "1.  Imagine you're on a treasure map. The note says: \"Walk 3 steps East, then 2 steps North.\"\n",
    "2.  \"East\" and \"North\" are your two main directions. These are your **basis vectors**.\n",
    "3.  If you define \"1 step East\" as a basis vector and \"1 step North\" as another, these are also **unit vectors** because their length is 1 step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In math, we often use **î** (i-hat) for the unit vector in the x-direction and **ĵ** (j-hat) for the unit direction in the y-direction.\n",
    "-   **î** = $\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$ (1 step right, 0 steps up)\n",
    "-   **ĵ** = $\\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}$ (0 steps right, 1 step up)\n",
    "\n",
    "Any vector can be built by **scaling** (making them longer or shorter) and then **adding** these basis vectors together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Example\n",
    "The vector $\\vec{v} = \\begin{bmatrix}3 \\\\ 2\\end{bmatrix}$ can be written as:\n",
    "$3 * \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix} + 2 * \\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix} = 3î + 2ĵ$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means: \"Take 3 of your x-axis unit vectors (î) and 2 of your y-axis unit vectors (ĵ) and add them together.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "1.  Imagine you have one vector pointing East. You can only stretch or shrink it. The span of this single vector is **every point on the infinite East-West line** that it lies on. It's a 1D line.\n",
    "2.  Now, imagine you have our two vectors, East (î) and North (ĵ). You can scale î to move East/West and scale ĵ to move North/South. By combining these moves, you can reach **any point on the entire 2D map**. The span of î and ĵ is the entire 2D plane.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 3. Linear Independence\n",
    "\n",

    "A set of vectors is **linearly independent** if you cannot create any one of them by scaling and adding the others together. Each vector adds a *new direction* that wasn't already there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "1.  Look at your set of vectors.\n",
    "2.  Ask: \"Can I make one of these vectors by stretching/shrinking and then adding the others?\"\n",
    "    -   If the answer is **NO**, the set is linearly independent.\n",
    "    -   If the answer is **YES**, the set is linearly *de*pendent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Example\n",
    "-   **Independent**: î ($\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$) and ĵ ($\\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}$) are independent. You cannot get purely North motion by only stretching East motion, and vice-versa.\n",
    "-   **Dependent**: î ($\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$) and $\\vec{u} = \\begin{bmatrix}2 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$ are *de*pendent. Why? Because you can get $\\vec{u}$ just by stretching î: $2 * \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}2 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$. The vector $\\vec{u}$ doesn't add a new direction; it's already inside the \"span\" of î.\n",

    "## 4. Linear Dependence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "A set of vectors is **linearly dependent** if at least one vector in the set can be written as a combination of the others. This means this vector is redundant—it doesn't add any new information about a direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "This is the opposite of independence.\n",
    "1.  Look at your set of vectors.\n",
    "2.  Ask: \"Is one of these vectors just a scaled-up or scaled-down version of another, or a combination of several others?\"\n",
    "3.  If yes, then the set is linearly dependent. You could remove that vector and have the exact same span.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Example\n",
    "Vectors: $\\vec{a} = \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 2\\end{bmatrix}$, $\\vec{b} = \\begin{bmatrix}2 \\\\ 4\\end{bmatrix}$, $\\vec{c} = \\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Are these dependent? **Yes!**\n",
    "Notice that $\\vec{b}$ is just 2 times $\\vec{a}$: $2 * \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 2\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}2 \\\\ 4\\end{bmatrix}$. So $\\vec{b}$ is redundant. The important, independent vectors here are just $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{c}$.\n",

    "The **null space** of a matrix (which represents a transformation) is the set of all vectors that, when the transformation is applied to them, get squished to the zero vector ($\\vec{0}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Explanation\n",
    "1.  A matrix `A` can be thought of as a function or a transformation: it takes an input vector $\\vec{v}$ and gives an output vector $\\vec{w}$ ($A\\vec{v} = \\vec{w}$).\n",

    "Let's use a simple matrix $A = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix}$. This matrix takes any vector $\\begin{bmatrix}x \\\\ y\\end{bmatrix}$ and outputs $\\begin{bmatrix}x \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$ (it keeps the x-value but crushes the y-value to 0).\n",

    "## 6. Linear Transformations and Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "A **linear transformation** is a rule for moving vectors around that keeps the grid lines parallel and evenly spaced. The origin (0,0) must stay fixed. A **matrix** is a neat grid of numbers that gives us instructions for performing a specific linear transformation.\n",

    "    -   **Lines stay lines**: Straight lines before the transformation must still be straight lines after.\n",
    "    -   **Origin stays fixed**: The point (0,0) must map to (0,0).\n",
    "3.  The magic is: **You can describe any linear transformation entirely by seeing what it does to the basis vectors (î and ĵ).**\n",
    "4.  The new location of î becomes the **first column** of the transformation matrix.\n",
    "5.  The new location of ĵ becomes the **second column** of the transformation matrix.\n",

    "## 11. How Matrices Perform Transformations: 90° Rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a tiny `2x2` matrix to tell a computer how to rotate any point in a 2D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rotation Transformation Matrix\n",
    "To rotate a point **90 degrees counterclockwise** around the origin `(0, 0)`, we use this special matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R_{90^\\circ} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "0 & -1 \\\\\n",
    "1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works (Step-by-Step):**\n",
    "Let's rotate the point `(3, 5)`.\n",
    "1.  Write the point as a column matrix: $P = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "2.  Multiply the rotation matrix by the point matrix:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    0 & -1 \\\\\n",
    "    1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "    \\times\n",
    "    \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    3 \\\\\n",
    "    5 \\\\\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "    =\n",
    "    \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    (0 \\times 3) + (-1 \\times 5) \\\\\n",
    "    (1 \\times 3) + (0 \\times 5) \\\\\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "    =\n",
    "    \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "    -5 \\\\\n",
    "    3 \\\\\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "3.  The new point is `(-5, 3)`! The matrix math correctly spun it 90°.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual:**\n",
    "Let's imagine it. The original point `(3, 5)` is in the top-right quadrant. After a 90° counterclockwise rotation, it moves to the top-left quadrant at `(-5, 3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Imagine a graph here)\n",
    "*   Original Point: (3, 5)  ->  ●\n",
    "*   Rotated Point: (-5, 3) ->  ●\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Application:**\n",
    "This exact math is running inside your computer right now!\n",
    "-   When you rotate a picture in Photoshop or your phone's gallery.\n",
    "-   When a character turns in a game like Minecraft or Roblox.\n",
    "-   When a GPS map on your parent's phone rotates to face the correct direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer doesn't \"see\" a picture. It sees a collection of thousands of points. It uses a rotation matrix on *every single point* to rotate the entire image. It does this billions of times per second!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Tip:** The next time you play a video game or turn your phone, remember—a matrix multiplication is probably happening millions of times a second to make that possible! 🤯\n",
