    "## __Summary__\n",
    "Matrices are like organized boxes of numbers that help us work with lots of data at once. We'll learn how to add, subtract, and multiply them, and discover how they're used in real-life technology like video games and AI!\n",

    "## 1. Addition and Subtraction of Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "A matrix is a rectangular arrangement of numbers in rows and columns. We can only add or subtract matrices that are the same size (same number of rows and columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Let's add two matrices showing scores from a video game:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Week 1 scores:     Week 2 scores:\n",
    "[ 5  3 ]          [ 2  4 ]\n",
    "[ 1  2 ]          [ 3  1 ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step solution:**\n",
    "1. Check they're the same size (both are 2x2)\n",
    "2. Add numbers in the same positions:\n",
    "   - Top-left: 5 + 2 = 7\n",
    "   - Top-right: 3 + 4 = 7\n",
    "   - Bottom-left: 1 + 3 = 4\n",
    "   - Bottom-right: 2 + 1 = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "[ 7  7 ]\n",
    "[ 4  3 ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Use Case\n",
    "Video game developers use matrix addition to:\n",
    "- Combine player scores from different levels\n",
    "- Add bonus points to player stats\n",
    "- Calculate total resources in strategy games\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "- Always check matrix sizes first!\n",
    "- Remember: `[a b] + [c d] = [a+c b+d]`\n",

    "## 2. Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "Matrix multiplication is different from regular multiplication. We multiply rows by columns and add the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Multiply these matrices showing cookie sales:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "[ 2  3 ]        [ 5 ]\n",
    "                [ 2 ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step:**\n",
    "1. Multiply row 1 by column 1: (2 × 5) + (3 × 2) = 10 + 6 = 16\n",
    "2. That's it! The result is a 1×1 matrix: [16]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total money made = $16**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Example\n",
    "```\n",
    "[ a b ]   [ e ]   [ ae + bf ]\n",
    "[ c d ] × [ f ] = [ ce + df ]\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Real-World Use\n",
    "- Calculating total costs in stores\n",
    "- Computer graphics (moving characters in games)\n",
    "- Science experiments with multiple measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "- Number of columns in 1st matrix must equal rows in 2nd matrix\n",
    "- Result matrix has rows from 1st and columns from 2nd\n",
    "- Use the \"row times column\" method\n",

    "## 3. Why Matrix Multiplication Matters in AI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Explanation\n",
    "Matrix multiplication helps computers:\n",
    "1. **Recognize patterns** (like identifying cats in photos)\n",
    "2. **Make decisions** (like suggesting videos you might like)\n",
    "3. **Learn from examples** (like practicing with flashcards)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "When you ask a smart speaker about weather:\n",
    "1. Your voice → converted to number matrix\n",
    "2. Matrix multiplication helps understand words\n",
    "3. Another matrix multiplication generates response\n",

    "## 4. Determinants (2×2 Matrices)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "The determinant is a special number calculated from a square matrix. For 2×2 matrices, it tells us about the \"area scaling factor.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula\n",
    "For matrix:\n",

    "[ a b ]\n",

    "[ 1  4 ]\n",
    "\n",
    "Determinant = (3×4) - (2×1) = 12 - 2 = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Meaning\n",
    "If the matrix transforms a shape, the absolute value of the determinant tells us how much the area changes!\n",

    "- Only square matrices have determinants\n",

    "# 5. Determinant of a 3×3 Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "The determinant of a 3×3 matrix is a special number that tells us about the \"volume scaling factor\" of the transformation represented by the matrix. It helps determine if the matrix can be inverted and is useful in solving systems of equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Calculation\n",
    "For a 3×3 matrix:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[ a  b  c ]\n",
    "[ d  e  f ]\n",
    "[ g  h  i ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The determinant is calculated as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "det = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Let's find the determinant of:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[ 1  2  3 ]\n",
    "[ 4  5  6 ]\n",
    "[ 7  8  9 ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step solution:**\n",
    "1. Identify the elements:\n",
    "   - a=1, b=2, c=3\n",
    "   - d=4, e=5, f=6\n",
    "   - g=7, h=8, i=9\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply the formula:\n",
    "   - a(ei − fh) = 1×(5×9 − 6×8) = 1×(45 − 48) = 1×(−3) = −3\n",
    "   - b(di − fg) = 2×(4×9 − 6×7) = 2×(36 − 42) = 2×(−6) = −12\n",
    "   - c(dh − eg) = 3×(4×8 − 5×7) = 3×(32 − 35) = 3×(−3) = −9\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Combine the results:\n",
    "   det = (−3) − (−12) + (−9) = −3 + 12 − 9 = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result: The determinant is 0**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Representation\n",
    "Imagine the matrix transforms a 3D cube. A determinant of 0 means the cube gets flattened into a 2D shape (losing volume), which is why the matrix can't be inverted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Use Cases\n",
    "1. **Computer Graphics**: Determining if a 3D transformation preserves volume\n",
    "2. **Engineering**: Solving systems of equations in structural analysis\n",
    "3. **Physics**: Calculating moments of inertia and other physical properties\n",
    "4. **Economics**: Input-output analysis in economic systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Case: Determinant of 0\n",
    "When det = 0, the matrix is called \"singular.\" This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The matrix doesn't have an inverse\n",
    "\n",
    "- The system of equations has either no solution or infinite solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "- The vectors represented by the rows/columns are linearly dependent\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips and Tricks\n",
    "1. **Pattern Memory**: Remember \"aei + bfg + cdh − ceg − bdi − afh\"\n",
    "2. **Sarrus' Rule**: Write first two columns again to the right, then multiply diagonals:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   [a b c] a b\n",
    "   [d e f] d e\n",
    "   [g h i] g h\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Sum of: (aei + bfg + cdh) − (ceg + bdi + afh)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Calculator Check**: Always verify with a calculator when possible\n",
    "4. **Zero Determinant**: If any row or column is all zeros, det = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember\n",
    "- The determinant helps understand if a matrix can be inverted\n",
    "\n",
    "- A zero determinant means the matrix \"collapses\" space\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3×3 determinants follow a specific pattern of diagonal multiplications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practice with different matrices to build confidence!\n",
