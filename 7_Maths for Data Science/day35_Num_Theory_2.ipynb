    "\n",
    "🔁 __Modular Arithmetic__\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular Arithmetic, also known as “clock arithmetic”, is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers wrap around after reaching a certain value — called the modulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a clock: after 12 hours, it starts again at 1. This wrapping behavior is modular math in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 __Basic Concept__\n",
    "\n",
    "In modular arithmetic, we write:  \n",
    "a ≡ b (mod n)  \n",
    "This means that when a is divided by n, it leaves the same remainder as b.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "17 ≡ 5 (mod 12)  \n",
    "Why? Because 17 ÷ 12 leaves a remainder of 5.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "🧮 __Simple Example__\n",
    "\n",
    "What is 10 + 8 mod 12?  \n",
    "→ (10 + 8) = 18  \n",
    "→ 18 mod 12 = 6  \n",
    "Because 18 ÷ 12 = 1 remainder 6\n",

    "\n",
    "🔐 Cryptography  \n",
    "- Modular arithmetic powers modern encryption (e.g., RSA algorithm).  \n",
    "- Secure key generation, hashing, and digital signatures rely on it.\n",

    "💻 Computer Science  \n",
    "- Efficient hash functions, random number generators, and memory addressing often use modulo operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "🎶 Music Theory  \n",
    "- Notes in music repeat every 12 tones (like 12 hours on a clock) → Mod 12\n",
    "- Useful in chord construction and scale mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "📅 Calendar Calculations  \n",
    "- Days of the week follow mod 7 logic  \n",
    "- Example: If today is Monday (Day 1), what day will it be in 10 days?  \n",
    "  → (1 + 10) mod 7 = 11 mod 7 = 4 → Thursday\n",
    "\n",
    "📊 Game Design / Graphics  \n",
    "- Looping positions, animations, and round counters use modulo logic  \n",
    "- Example: looping player turns — mod total players\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "🔄 __Common Modulo Properties__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (a + b) mod n = (a mod n + b mod n) mod n  \n",
